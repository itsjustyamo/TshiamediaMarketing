# Tshiamedia Marketing Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of Tshiamedia Marketing, a website created by Tshiamo Tsoku for a marketing agency called "Tshiamedia Marketing".

## Overview
Tshiamedia Marketing Backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves as the server-side logic and API endpoints for the Tshiamedia Marketing website, handling data processing, database interactions, and external API integrations.

## Features
- RESTful API endpoints for handling client requests.
- MongoDB integration for storing and managing data.
- Integration with external APIs for fetching additional data (e.g., Twitter API).

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.


## Difficulties Faced
- Ensuring all routes worked: It was challenging to ensure that all the routes in the backend were correctly implemented and functioning as expected. Debugging and testing each route thoroughly required careful attention to detail.
- Fetching data for each route: Fetching data from various sources and APIs for different routes posed challenges, especially when handling asynchronous operations and ensuring data consistency.
- Overall, overcoming these challenges required patience, perseverance, and meticulous testing to ensure the backend operated smoothly.

## What I'm Most Proud Of
I'm most proud of the data integration in the backend and how it came together in the end. Using actual business data from Tshiamedia Marketing, I brought the data to life within the application, providing valuable insights and information to users. This process involved careful planning, data modeling, and implementation to ensure the data was accurately represented and accessible through the API endpoints.
